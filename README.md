# STR Testing Report for Planet App

## Project Overview
This Software Testing Report (STR) was created for the **Planet App** – a cinema booking app. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the functionality, usability, and overall performance of the Planet App. The testing was part of my QA training at **Automation College**.

The **Planet App** allows users to browse available movies, view showtimes, and book tickets for their preferred movies. The app is available on multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and Web. The objective of this STR was to perform a thorough assessment of the app to ensure it meets its functional requirements and provides a seamless user experience.

## Testing Scope
The testing for this project covered the following key areas:
- **Functional Testing**: Verifying the app’s features, ensuring they work as expected.
- **Usability Testing**: Assessing the app’s design and overall user experience.
- **Compatibility Testing**: Ensuring the app performs well across different platforms (iOS, Android, Windows).
- **Accessibility Testing**: Checking compliance with accessibility standards.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensuring no features were negatively impacted by recent updates.

## Test Scenarios
Here are some of the key test scenarios I executed during this project:
1. **Login and Authentication**: Verifying the user login and registration process.
2. **Movie Selection**: Ensuring users can easily browse and select movies.
3. **Ticket Booking**: Testing the ticket booking flow and payment process.
4. **Viewing Ticket History**: Verifying that users can view their past bookings.
5. **Error Handling**: Testing how the app handles errors such as invalid user input or unavailable tickets.
6. **Cross-Platform Functionality**: Ensuring the app works consistently on different platforms (Android, iOS, Web).

## Test Results and Bugs
- **Test Cases Executed**: Over **185 test cases** were executed, covering a wide range of scenarios.
- **Bugs Identified**: A total of **39 bugs** were found, categorized by severity levels ranging from minor UI issues to critical functionality bugs.

### Bug Severity Breakdown:
- **High Severity**: 5 bugs (Critical issues affecting functionality).
- **Medium Severity**: 18 bugs (Issues with usability or performance).
- **Low Severity**: 16 bugs (Minor UI issues or cosmetic errors).

All identified bugs were documented and reported to the development team through Jira for further resolution.

## Conclusion
The testing revealed several issues, including critical bugs that need addressing before the app can be considered fully functional. The app generally works well, but improvements in error handling, UI responsiveness, and cross-platform functionality are needed.
